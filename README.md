# **Mkopa Loan Status Prediction**
This is a machine learning  classification model which is trained through supervised learning to predict a 
customer loan status over a period of 360 days that is into:
  - Active: The customer is still actively repaying their loan.
  - Blocked: The customer has had their account blocked after more than 30 days without a payment.
  - Finished Payment: The customer has successfully repaid their loan.
## Models used And Evaluation Metrics  
- Used four models(Logistic Regression,KNeighboursClassifier,Random Forest,Decision Trees) and found 
the random forest classifier having the best results.
- Used F1 score to evaluate the performance of the models since the dataset was imbalanced.
## **Prerequisites**
Ensure the following are installed:
 * Anaconda and Python3
 * Libraries:Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,Seaborn,pandas_profiling
 * Use conda or pip commands to install the libraries
## Running the model
   - Clone the repository
   - Open Anaconda Navigator
   - Open the notebook using Jupiter Notebook or convert the repository to your preffered formart(.py etc)
   - Run the model to view the results.
